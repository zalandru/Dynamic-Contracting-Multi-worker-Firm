    "Three different worker types identified based on the transition patterns: α,β,γ\n",
    "γ-type workers stay less on the same job, receive higher losses upon displacement, and stay unemployed longer.\n",
    "They build a Menzio-Shi type model with persistent heterogeneity in match quality distribution across worker types to match this observed heterogeneity.\n",
    "The key cool suggestion is that a lot of the micro and macro facts are driven solely by this small proportion of γ-type workers"
