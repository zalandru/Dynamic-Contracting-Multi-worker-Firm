    "Could I explain the education part somehow? Potentially, yes if these guys have some info on their match quality. Or, even in a more basic sense, that their prior for match quality is higher, so they dont expect to get fired, so they don't search for jobs elsewhere\n",
    "Essentially, I have the following chain: more education -> less firing risk (via HMQ) -> less likely to find a diff-nt job (via OJS)\n",
    "But no need for DRS here + modified Balke-Lamadon (lower effort cost for educated workers) may accomplish it, too"
