By restricting those out-of-equilibrium beliefs, one can sometimes eliminate many unintuitive equilibria. We present a number of formal restrictions of this sort, investigate their behavior in specific examples, and relate these restrictions to Kohlberg and Mertens' notion of stability.},

abstract = {Many economic models include random shocks imposed on a large number (continuum) of economic agents with individual risk. In this context, an exact law of large numbers and its converse is presented in [Y.N. Sun, The exact law of large numbers via Fubini extension and characterization of insurable risks, J. Econ. Theory 126 (2006) 31–69] to characterize the cancellation of individual risk via aggregation. However, it is well known that the Lebesgue unit interval is not suitable for modeling a continuum of agents in the particular setting. The purpose of this paper is to show that an extension of the Lebesgue unit interval does work well as an agent space with various desirable properties associated with individual risk.}

  institution={University Library of Munich, Germany},
  type={MPRA Paper},
  number={98240},
  abstract={In this paper we analyze cyclicality of wages at the job level, using posted wage data from an online job board in an emerging economy. Our data contains a significant fraction of online job advertisements in the Chilean economy for the period 2009 to 2018 and is representative of the overall wage distribution of newly hired workers. One major advantage of our dataset is the availability of wage information along information on requirements for each job. We find significant levels of posted wage procyclicality, safely ignoring any cyclical mismatch. We show how omitted variable bias, by ignoring countercyclical changes in hiring standards, reduces the amount of cyclicality found in previous studies.},
