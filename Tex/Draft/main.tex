%\begin{abstract}
%Wage rigidity as an amplification mechanism for the volatility of unemployment requires that jobs with rigid wages actually hire unemployed workers (rather than poach them from other firms). I differentiate jobs based on their hiring pool: whether they hire mostly unemployed or employed workers - and separately estimate their wage cyclicality. Using French matched employer-employee panel data, I find that wage rigidity varies significantly across jobs, with those engaging in worker poaching exhibiting more cyclical wages. I develop a labor search model with separation of search and heterogeneous wage cyclicality to measure the importance of distinguishing jobs by their hiring pool. The model reveals that rigid wages in jobs hiring unemployed workers have a disproportionately large effect on unemployment volatility compared to jobs poaching workers. Incorporating this heterogeneity yields a $20\%$ increase in unemployment volatility.

\section{Conclusion}
%I estimate wage cyclicality separately for different jobs, based on their hiring pools. I use the matched employer-employee data to find that wages, both for new and incumbent workers, are significantly more rigid in jobs hiring from unemployment than in jobs poaching workers. I then simulate a model incorporating the separation of search and heterogeneous wage rigidity across different submarkets to find that wage rigidity in the entry-level submarket matters significantly more for the volatility of unemployment than in the higher submarkets. Together, the empirical and the theoretical results imply that, for unemployment volatility purposes, wages are highly rigid. I confirm this by comparing the heterogeneous wage cyclicality calibration of the model to the homogeneous one and find that accounting for the heterogeneity across jobs increases the unemployment volatility by $20\%$.
%Moreover, the higher up the ladder is the submarket, the less important is its wage rigidity.  This goes in the direction of solving the unemployment volatility puzzle.

%Potential interesting application of the empirical result could be explaining some of the business cycle-related job ladder facts. As one example, \textcite{moscarini2018} find that the job-to-job transition rate is procyclical, and especially so at the bottom of the job ladder. This might be because wages at the bottom of the ladder are too high during recessions, thus disincentivizing workers from transitioning to a different job. It would also be interesting to understand where the observed heterogeneity in wage cyclicality stems from.
